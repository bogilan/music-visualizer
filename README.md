# Music Visualizer
Music Visualizer created with JavaScript, Web Audio API and Canvas.

This is a JavaScript-based music visualizer that displays animated graphics in response to music. It utilizes technologies like the Web Audio API and Canvas to create captivating visualizations synchronized with the audio.

Features:
- Real-time frequency analysis: The audio is processed using the Web Audio API's AnalyserNode to obtain frequency data, which is then used to generate visualizations.
- Dynamic bar visualization: The visualizer renders a set of bars that represent different frequency bins, with their height and color changing based on the audio data.
- Play, pause, and stop controls: The interface includes buttons to control the audio playback and freeze or reset the visualization.

How to Use:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Add your audio file (in supported formats) to the project directory.
3. Open the project in a web browser.
4. Click the play button to start the audio and visualization.
5. Use the pause button to freeze the visualization at any point.
6. Click the stop button to reset the audio and visualization to the beginning.

Feel free to customize and enhance the visualizer by modifying the code or adding your own visual effects.
